# Machine-Learning
This file displays some of the machine learning techniques.

In this project, we want to train data to predict the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis. This is a linear regression and is an example of 
supervised machine learning. 

There various ways to work with this dataset, but I tried Sequential model, which was new and advance for me, but it was a great learning process. A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor. So, this is an appropriate model for this project.
